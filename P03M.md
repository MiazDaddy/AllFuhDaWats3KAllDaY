    From age to age the haggard human train
        Creeps wearily across Time's burning sands
        To look into her face, and lift weak hands
    In supplication to the calm disdain
    That crowns her stony brow.... But all in vain
        The riddle of mortality they try:
        Doom speaks still from her unrelenting eye--
    Doom deep as passion, infinite as pain.
    From age to age the voice of Love is heard
        Pleading above the tumult of the throng,
    But evermore the inexorable word
        Comes like the tragic burden of a song.
    "The answer is the same," the stern voice saith:
    "Death yesterday, today and still tomorrow--Death!"
